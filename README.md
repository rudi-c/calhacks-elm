[Click here to view project](http://rudi-c.github.io/calhacks-elm) -- make sure to put a floor (bottom row) before going into game mode!

This is a project made at [CalHacks](http://www.calhacks.io/). The goal of the project was to learn [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/), a great new language for reactive front-end web development by making a very simple platformer game editor (and associated, equally simple game engine).
